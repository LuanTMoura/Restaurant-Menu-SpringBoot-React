 ## What I've learned?

- 

# How to install and run on my machine?

## Installation

Search for your cmd program or PowerShell (for Windows Users) and run this:
```
git clone https://github.com/LuanTMoura/Restaurant-Menu-SpringBoot-React.git
```

If you prefer another way, inside this repository, search for the green button "<Code>" and choose between Open with GitHub Desktop or Download Zip.

## Run

**Recommendations and disclaimer:**

- Use IntelliJ or another IDE that support and gives the best experience with Java Applications.

- If something goes bad with images display, check out on the archive ``FoodController`` class from Spring Boot project inside the path ``controllers`` and search the code ``@CrossOrigin(origins = "http://localhost:{port}")``, just change the ``{port}`` for the port where react application is working, example: ``http://localhost:5173/``.

### Inside the Spring Boot path
Search for terminal and paste this command or just search for a button of Run or click above the archive ``SpringbootApplication.java`` with right side of your mouse and run the project.
```java
mvn spring-boot:run
```

### Inside the React Application path
Search for terminal and paste this command.
```tsx
npm run dev
```
Again, if something goes bad, just do the recommendation among the intructions.
